# Flight Delay Prediction ✈️

## 📌 Overview
Flight delays cause significant operational inefficiencies and financial losses in the aviation industry. 
This project builds a machine learning model to analyze historical flight data and predict potential delays.

The objective is to identify key factors influencing delays and develop a predictive system that can assist airlines in better operational planning.

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains historical flight records including:

- Airline
- Origin & Destination Airports
- Departure Time
- Arrival Time
- Weather-related features
- Delay indicators

(Data preprocessing and cleaning were performed before model training.)

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- SHAP (Model Interpretability)

---

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training (Random Forest / other models used)
5. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, MAE, etc.)
6. Feature Importance Analysis using SHAP

---

## 📈 Results
The model successfully identifies key factors contributing to flight delays and achieves strong predictive performance on test data.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Deploy the model using Flask/Streamlit
- Real-time delay prediction system
- Integration with live aviation APIs
